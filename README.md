# LightTube

Progresive Web App
Built with PetiteVue, Youtube API, Tailwind CSS

I built this app because the android head unit(radio) on my car no longer is supported by youtube.

I developed this app to learn new things and so this was my first progresive web app and first time using an API, Tailwind CSS, browser storage, and petite-vue.

Key Features:
Search for youtube videos, play videos, video History
